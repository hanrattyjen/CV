## Jennifer Hanratty

A Junior Software Developer who wants to continue to learn more and more and more, developing and broadening her skills in agile environments.

After taking some time out to be at home with 3 awesome little people, I wanted to get back to work and realised that what I had done before no longer interested me.

I am currently enrolled in the Makers Academy Remote course, aiming to re-skill myself and change careers completely.

I have a real love of learning, which translates well into the work I've done this year.

#### What I am

* Incredibly motivated to learn all that I can get my hands on.
* Curious about how everything works and what I can do to contribute to it.
* Organised & practical - really boring traits but I am one of the most organised people I know. 3 children + Makers Academy === a need to be completely organised all of the time!

I have a [blog](https://medium.com/@hanratty.jen) that is updated weekly(ish!).

## What I have gotten out of Makers Academy

#### Skills

Got lots of new mad skills. By the end of week 6, my group of 4 people had built an airBnb clone using Ruby and Sinatra, all fully-tested and working and looking good. This has increased my confidence so much.

Now that I know what can be done in only a few days, I'm so excited to see what I can achieve in the next 6 weeks, 6 months and 6 years.

#### Focus

I was self-taught pre-Makers. I had been learning for almost a year before I started, using a mixture of online resources such as Treehouse, Pluralsight, Code Academy, Khan Academy, and tech books.

I found however that the more I learned, the more I could see how much there actually was out there and I got suckered into going too many directions, not really knowing the best path to follow.

Of course I know that there is no set *best* path to follow, but Makers did enable me to refine my learning and to provide the best possible way for me to continue post-course on my own.

#### New relationships

I've met so many new people from MA. Pre-course, I assumed that because I was a remote student, this would be quite a solitary experience. But I was incredibly wrong.

The use of XP meant that we were assigned a new pair partner every single day. This was quite a daunting thought at the start of the course but it is something that I really got a lot out of and I think it helped progress our learning a lot more than if we were on our own.
