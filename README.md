A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what you're looking for: what you would ideally be doing, with whom and in what environment.

#### What I got out of Makers Academy
* Focus
  I was self-taught pre-Makers. I had been learning for almost a year before I started, using a mixture of online resources such as Treehouse,
  Pluralsight, Code Academy, Khan Academy, and tech books. I found however that the more I learned, the more I could see how much there actually
  was out there and I got suckered into going too many directions, not really knowing the best path to follow. Of course I know that there is no set *best* path to follow, but Makers did enable me to refine my learning and to provide the best possible way for me to continue post-course on my own.
* New relationships
  I've met so many new people from MA. Pre-course, I assumed that because I was a remote student, this would be quite a solitary experience.
  But I was incredibly wrong. The use of Extreme Programming meant that we were assigned a new pair partner every single day. This was quite a
  daunting thought at the start of the course but it is something that I really got a lot out of and I think it helped progress our learning a
  lot more than if we were on our own.
* Skills
  Got lots of new mad skills. By the end of week 6, my group of 4 people had built an airBnb clone using Ruby and Sinatra, all fully-tested and
  working and looking good. This has increased my confidence so much. Now that I know what can be done in only a few days, I'm so excited to see what I can acheive in the next 6 weeks, 6 months and 6 years. This is just the beginning of the next stage of my life and it's really feckin exciting.
