## Jennifer Hanratty

Junior Software Developer looking for first technical role in an agile environment.

#### How I chose this path

After taking time out to be at home with 3 awesome little people and realising that the roles I had previously didn't interest me as they once had, I decided to shake things up a bit.

It took me a while to figure out what I wanted to do. I love learning; I love maths and figuring out problems.

I began my coding journey almost accidentally. I did some maths courses online and this led me to some coding courses. It was only after messing around with code for a few months, talking to people and attending meet-ups that I realised that this was something I wanted to do full-time.

I have just graduated from [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/), a highly intensive coding bootcamp completed over 16 weeks. This has enabled me to transition fully into the role of a Junior Developer and provided me with many of the fundamental skills required for this role today.

I am involved with [Django Girls Belfast](https://djangogirls.org/belfast/), who provide one-day workshops to women who want to learn to build their own web apps using Python and Django. There is an incredible demand for this workshop - it's amazing!

#### 3 things about me

* Incredibly motivated to learn all that I can get my hands on.
* Excited about digital education and what I can do to contribute to it.
* Organised & practical. 3 small children + Makers Academy === a need to be completely organised all of the time!

I have a [blog](https://medium.com/@hanratty.jen) that is updated regularly.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (September - December 2016)

Makers Academy instills valuable qualities on their students during their time on the course. These include vital skills such as teamwork and communication, independent problem-solving and and best practise.

##### Development Approach

Instead of formally being taught a language (although we do learn Ruby & Javascript during the course), we are also seen as language-agnostic and taught **how** to learn a language and write clean, readable code.

We are also involved in agile development, TDD and BDD, and delivering value to a user. We had regular code reviews, either as part of a large group or in smaller groups.

As well as my coding skills improving massively during my time at Makers Academy, so has my ability to learn. How I approach new problems and how I can communicate those to other people has been refined so much and I'm much more comfortable expressing my ideas.

Given how far I've come in the past 16 weeks, I'm very excited to see what I can achieve in the next 16 weeks, 16 months and beyond.

##### Communication

I have met a lot of new people through Makers Academy. I assumed that a remote course would make for a solitary experience, but I was incredibly wrong.

The use of XP practises meant that we were assigned a new pair partner every single day. This was quite a daunting thought at the start of the course but it is something that I really got a lot out of and I think it helped progress our learning a lot more than if we were on our own.

##### Technical skills

* Fundamentals of Object Oriented Programming.
* Ruby, Rails, Sinatra
* JavaScript, Node.js, Meteor.JS, AJAX, JQuery
* HTML, CSS, Git
* Relational databases; Postgres, Datamapper and Active Record
* Non-relational database Mongo

* Made a lot of use of open source - everything we have used has been open source.

#### Queens University Belfast (2007-2011)

* BSc Business Economics - 2.1
* Some modules I really enjoyed included Game Theory, Statistics, Advanced Micro & Macro Economics, Marketing, International Business.

#### Queens University Belfast (2001-2003)
* BSc Mathematics - N/a
* I did not complete this degree. However I picked up some really useful skills and interests during my time, such as Mathematical Reasoning, Functions & Numerical Analysis, Calculus, Set Theory, Statistics and Operational Research.

#### Other qualifications

## Personal Projects

#### Hack the Hub event September 2016
* Our group of 4 spent the day building a web application called [Volunteer Me](https://hth-volunteer.herokuapp.com/) to make Belfast better. We made use of Open Data NI to build a social network that could bring together volunteers and charities in a fun way and make better use of the amazing people that live in Northern Ireland. This was a fun and eye-opening day. Being surrounded by so much talent was really great and provided a lot of inspiration as to the type of developer I would like to become.
