## Jennifer Hanratty

I am a Junior Software Developer who wants to continue to learning as much as I can, developing and broadening my skills in agile environments.

After taking some time out to be at home with 3 awesome little people and after realising that what I had done before wasn't quite what I was interested in anymore, I decided to change things up a bit.

It took me a while to figure out what exactly I wanted to do with my life. I love learning, I love maths and figuring out problems.

I began my coding journey almost accidentally. I did some maths courses online just to get my brain working and this led to me finding some online coding courses. I had discounted the idea of a career in the tech industry as I assumed, as most people do, that you need a Computer Science degree for that. It was only after messing around with code for a few months, talking to people and attending MeetUps, that I realised that this was something I could actually do as a full-time job. It all took off from there..

I am currently enrolled in the Makers Academy Remote course, at level complete of re-skilling myself and changing careers completely.

I am also involved with Django Girls Belfast, who provide one-day workshops to women who want to learn to build their own web apps using Python and Django. There is an incredible demand for this workshop - every time we run it we increase our numbers of applicants. It's really exciting.

#### What I am

* Incredibly motivated to learn all that I can get my hands on.
* Curious about how everything works and what I can do to contribute to it.
* Organised & practical - really boring traits but I am one of the most organised people I know. 3 small children + Makers Academy === a need to be completely organised all of the time!

I have a [blog](https://medium.com/@hanratty.jen) that is updated weekly(ish!).

## Education

#### Makers Academy (September - December 2016)

* Instead of being taught a language (which we of course are), we are also seen as language-agnostic and taught **how** to learn a language. This is really cool!
* We are also involved in teamwork, best practice, TDD, agile, communication, delivering value to a user - and, most importantly, independent problem-solving.
* Fundamentals of Object Oriented Programming.
* Self-sufficient but can for help when needed!
* Ruby, Sinatra, Rails, JavaScript, Node.js, AJAX, JQuery, HTML, CSS, Git.
* Agile principles - XP, Software Craftsmanship, TDD, BDD.
* Testing frameworks - Rspec, Jasmine, Mocha.
* Made a lot of use of open source - practically everything we have used has been open source.

#### Queens University Belfast (2007-2011)

* BSc Business Economics - 2.1
* Some useful modules included Game Theory, Statistics, Advanced Micro & Macro Economics, Marketing, International Business.

#### Queens University Belfast (2001-2003)
* BSc Mathematics - N/a
* For reasons, I sadly did not complete my degree. However I picked up some really useful skills and interests during my time, such as Mathematical Reasoning, Functions & Numerical Analysis, Calculus, Set Theory, Statistics and Operational Research.

#### Other qualifications
* Front End Web Development track on Treehouse
* Microsoft Technology Associate: HTML5 Application Development Fundamentals - June 2016


## What I have gotten out of Makers Academy

#### Skills

Got lots of new mad skills. By the end of week 6, our group of 4 people had built an airBnb clone called [makersBnB](https://github.com/hanrattyjen/makersbnb) using Ruby and Sinatra, all fully-tested and working and looking good.

This increased my confidence a lot and now that I know what can be done in only a few days, I'm very excited to see what I can achieve in the next 6 weeks, 6 months and 6 years.

#### Focus

I was self-taught pre-Makers. I had been learning for almost a year before I started, using a mixture of online resources such as Treehouse, Pluralsight, Code Academy, Khan Academy, and tech books.

I found however that the more I learned, the more I could see how much there actually was out there and I got suckered into going too many directions, not really knowing the best path to follow.

Whilst I know that there is no set *best* path to follow, Makers did enable me to refine my learning and to provide the best possible way for me to continue post-course on my own.

#### New relationships

I've met so many new people from MA. Pre-course, I assumed that because I was a remote student, this would be quite a solitary experience. But I was incredibly wrong.

The use of XP meant that we were assigned a new pair partner every single day. This was quite a daunting thought at the start of the course but it is something that I really got a lot out of and I think it helped progress our learning a lot more than if we were on our own.
